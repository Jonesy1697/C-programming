# C-programming
This project contains the code for the C practice tutorials, which aim to develop personal C programming skills, ranging from  basic, to more advance concepts. The code has been created following online tutorials, http://www.learn-c.org/, with each folder corresponding to a listed lesson on the page.  

## Getting Started
Before working with the code, ensure that there is a form of text editor, preferably one that allows for editing of C code, and a method of compilation on the target computer. During creation, the software used was Visual Studio, with a C++ add on, where the code extension was then edited for C code as opposed to C++. Visual Studio also came with a developer command line, which was then used in compilation and execution of the finished code. A link to Visual Studio will be found below, with the "Built With" section of the readme.
