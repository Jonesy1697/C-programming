# C-programming
This project contains the code for the C practice tutorials, which aim to develop personal C programming skills, ranging from  basic, to more advance concepts. The code has been created following online tutorials, http://www.learn-c.org/, with each folder corresponding to a listed lesson on the page.  

## Getting Started
Before working with the code, ensure that there is a form of text editor, preferably one that allows for editing of C code, and a method of compilation on the target computer. During creation, the software used was Visual Studio, with a C++ add on, where the code extension was then edited for C code as opposed to C++. Visual Studio also came with a developer command line, which was then used in compilation and execution of the finished code. A link to Visual Studio will be found below, with the "Built With" section of the readme.

### Prerequisites
The tutorials work best by following the order written in, as they get progressively harder. Further explanation, with more examples, can be found on the tutorial website, http://www.learn-c.org/.

### Installing
When downloading te source code, ensure that the code is stored in an appropiate folder, that is easy to find and navigate to in a command line interface. This will make it easier to test and execute completed code. All source code must be compiled from a .c extension to .exe, which in this example was done through the command line with the cl command, with the following format:
```
cl file.c
```
When using a .exe file, through either the examples or self-created, ensure that the compiled code is being executed in the command line, as many of the programs will have printline commands, which are only viewable on the command line.
